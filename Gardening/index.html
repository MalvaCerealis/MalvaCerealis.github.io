            <p> <h1>Seedlings 101 (Hardiness Zone 5)</h1> <br>
              <h3>Types of Seeds</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Open pollinated - flower fertilized by nature. Same plant next year</li>
                <li>Heirloom - seed passed down the generations based on specific trait of plant. Always really robust and cool</li>
                <li>F1 Hybrids - result of 2 plants w/ specific characteristics being deliberately crossed to produce a new third variety</li>
                <li>Treated seeds - coated with chemical ,fungicide, or pesticide treated seeds. Identified by their label or colour of seeds, not organic.</li>
              </ul>
              Keep seeds away from moisture,etc. Germination is difficult for woody ornamental and native perennials. 
              To alleviate, soak seeds and put in ziploc bag with paper towel for 1 week, then thaw for 6-12 hours. Soak right before planting
              Example plants: Nasturtiums, beets, parsley, bergamot, lupine, spinach, milkweed <br> </p>
              <p>
              <h4>Shade Tolerant Plants (4-6 hrs)</h4>

              <ul>
              <li>Turnips</li>

              <li>Corn</li>
              <li>Potato</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Start from Seedling (haha) </h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Tomatoes</li>
                <li>Lettuce</li>
                <li>Kale</li>
                <li>Cabbage</li>
                <li>Onions, leeks</li>
                <li>Zucchini, okra</li>
                <li>Melons</li>
                <li>Squash</li>
                <li>Bok choy</li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Seedling Starting Equipment</h2>
             <h3>Potting Mix #1</h3>
             <ul> 
              <li>1 Coco Coir (⅓)</li>
              <li>1 Compost (⅓) (No chunks!)</li>
              <li>1 Vermiculite (⅓)</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Potting Mix #2</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>7L Peat +  ⅛ cup Lime → 4¾ cups perlite + ¾ cup fertilizer (bone&blood) → 2 ¼ L soil + 4 ¾ L compost</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>Containers</li> 
              <li>72 or 128 cells with drainage holes and trays under cells</li>
              <li>Lighting (Under grow lights like the Sunblaster light.)</li> 
              </ul>Set for 16-18hrs each day
              Keep 2-4 inches away from top leaf.
              Window sill is bad bc seedlings get leggy. You want unobstructed light.
              Fertilizer is a short term amendment but
              Your own compost is best. That said, you only need if plant is +4 weeks (idk what i meant by this so good luck).
              Fish fertilizer (Neptune Harvest) or promix fertilizer are good options if you want to use fertilizer. 
              </p> <p>
              <h2>When to Sow Seeds?</h2>
              Hot Crops: 6-8 weeks before last frost. <br>
              Cool Crops: 4-6 weeks.
              Seedlings should be in ground by ⅔ of their life cycle.
              Ex: Kale (65 days) is seedling for 42 days.
              <h3>Seed Density</h3>
              1 or 2 seeds per cell. If germination rate is less than 70% or seed packet is 2+ years old: 3-4 seeds.
              Resort to clumps for thyme, rosemary, basil, green onion, chives, and other frost-troubled herbs.
              <h2>Seedling Care</h2>
              Fruiting crops need fertilizer rich in Phosphorus (did you know the supply of P will be gone in like 30 years lol).
              Need strong roots and foliage to better photosynthesize -> Liquid absorbed better. Potting up -> Seedling from cell to bigger pot.
              <h3>Hardening Off</h3>
              <ul>
              <li>Introducing seedling to outdoors:</li>
              <li>Put in area covered from wind and with shade</li>
              <li>Do 1 week before you intend to plant</li>
              <li>Perennial root systems should be protected in the winter, cover them with mulch to ensure warmth</li>
              <li>Winter bad cus wind= soil erosion</li>
              <li>Snow is an epic insulator</li>
              <li>Above 25C for cool crops makes them not want to germinate</li>
              </ul>
              </p>
              <p>Bonus info: If you are space limited on compost, consider WORMS
                Red wriggler worms in container</p>
